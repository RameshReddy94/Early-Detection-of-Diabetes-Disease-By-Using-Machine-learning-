Early Detection of Diabetes Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of diabetes using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing health data, the system predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes, enabling early intervention and treatment.

Features
Utilizes supervised machine learning models for classification.
Supports various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Offers performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
The project uses a diabetes dataset, typically containing:

Pregnancies
Glucose levels
Blood pressure
Skin thickness
Insulin levels
BMI
Diabetes pedigree function
Age
Target variable: Outcome (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes)
Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and properly cleaned (handle missing values and outliers).

Steps to Run
Prepare Data:

Place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Update data preprocessing logic in data_preprocessing.py if needed.
Train Model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
This step preprocesses the data, trains the model, and saves it in the models/ directory.

Evaluate Model:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate_model.py
Evaluates the model's performance and displays metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Make Predictions:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py
Allows predictions on new data by loading the trained model.

Output
Classification of diabetes status (1 or 0) for test data.
Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Optional visualizations: Correlation heatmaps, feature importance plots, and ROC curves.
Key Machine Learning Techniques
Data normalization and scaling.
Feature selection and engineering.
Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search or Randomized Search.
Notes
Experiment with different algorithms to find the best-performing model.
Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling if required.
Regularly update the dataset for better predictions.
